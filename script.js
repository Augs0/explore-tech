There is often a misconception that Front End developers are effectively designers, but this is not strictly true. Sometimes Front End developers do deal with design, but often they are responsible for implementing designs built by others.',
      skills:
        "Some skills you might like to explore for front end development are HTML, CSS (potentially preprocessors like SASS), Javascript, frameworks like React, Vue, and Angular, CSS frameworks e.g. Bootstrap, Tailwind, as well as skills helpful across development like version control (e.g. Git) and toolkits like Gulp, Parcel, Webpack, etc. Front End developers should also aim to be mindful of responsive / mobile-first design as well as accessibility, as these are part of the user's experience in interacting with the site or app. Learning to test on the front end can also be very helpful. You can look at tools like Cypress, Selenium, Playwright, and React Testing Library.",

        "Some skills you might like to explore for Back End development are server-side languages like PHP, Python, Ruby, Ruby On Rails, Java, Javascript, server management like Node.js, database languages like MySQL and MongoDB, and, potentially, hosting server skills like AWS. It depends on what kind of work you're interested in! It can also be helpful to have a good understanding of Front End skills like HTML and CSS, and of course skills like version control are incredibly useful.",

The two often overlap and effectively what this field of work involves is designing sites and apps by creating mockups to be researched and tested, taking into account the journey the user goes on when using the platform and whether it's a good and intuitive experience for them. They may also be in charge of coming up with styling guides for developers to follow (e.g. fonts, colours, etc.).",

Languages often linked to this line of work include Python, Javascript, SQL, PHP, C, C++ and Assembly, however, you should be familiar with what the project or your company calls for.

      skills:
        'Technical skills can be very helpful in this role. You may find some individuals move into this kind of work after working in development themselves, but generally speaking, alongside the research and presentation skills required in this kind of work, business intelligence analysts may need skills in database management, languages like SQL, and understanding of related tools like PowerBI and SAS.',

Further to the platforms mentioned in the Cloud Engineer role, you will also need to have an understanding of things like networks (e.g. what are IP addresses, how does the DNS work?, etc), security, any legal or compliance issues that may need to be considered, container tools like Docker or Kubernetes, plus a variety of other skills.

A good understanding of version control is important as you may be involved in handling pull requests and communicating bugs and fixes with a larger team. Tools like Postman are used to test API routes. There are different kinds of QA testers out there and not all of them need code for their job - it varies. For example, QA testers exist in things like localization of video games, and these testers are looking at the output of the translations, making sure it makes sense. Sometimes QA testers in tech are also output-focused too and may not need to be as technically savvy as a developer.',

Often this role is described as bridging the gap between engineers or developers and members of teams like product or marketing to ensure everyone is on the same page. It should be noted that this sector is sometimes called Developer Relations or DevRel for short.",
