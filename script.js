There is often a misconception that frontend developers are effectively designers, but this is not strictly true. Sometimes frontend developers do deal with design, but often they are responsible for implementing designs built by others.',

It depends on what kind of work you're interested in! It can also be helpful to have a good understanding of frontend skills like HTML and CSS, and of course skills like version control are incredibly useful.",

    skills:
      'iOS developers often use Objective-C or Swift, with Swift being the more modern of the two. Android developers often use Java. That being said, React Native is a growing area of development which involves Javascript/React. Kotlin is also another option. Knowing other programming languages is also beneficial.',

    skills:
      "Given the variety of platforms and games, it's hard to list every skill here, but some popular languages are: C++, C#, Java, Javascript, HTML and Python. It may be helpful to become familiar with game engines (software frameworks within game development) too.

The two often overlap and effectively what this field of work involves is designing sites and apps by creating mockups to be researched and tested, taking into account the journey the user goes on when using the platform and whether it's a good and intuitive experience for them. They may also be in charge of coming up with styling guides for developers to follow (e.g. fonts, colours, etc.).",

Cyber-security technicians and analysts often are involved in ethical hacking, that is trying to purposefully break into systems and platforms to test how secure they are and to fix any potential problems that could lead to damage.",
    skills:
      'There are a number of certificates that may help you progress in cyber-security, such as CISSP. Languages often linked to this line of work include Python, Javascript, SQL, PHP, C, C++ and Assembly, however, you should be familiar with what the project or your company calls for.

Your job will be to analyse data, trends, user behaviour and more to help senior staff decide what direction to take the business.',
    skills:
      'Technical skills can be very helpful in this role. You may find some individuals move into this kind of work after working in development themselves, but generally speaking, alongside the research and presentation skills required in this kind of work, business intelligence analysts may need skills in database management, languages like SQL, and understanding of related tools like PowerBI and SAS.',

    role: 'Consultant',
    desc: 'Again, this kind of work may come after a career in technology as it will help you understand what skills companies are really looking for. Consultancy involves helping business find the best technological and software solutions for their company and situation, therefore, knowing how and why one language or framework might be chosen over another is key.',
    skills:
      "At the very least, technology and IT consultants should be aware of the market and sector they're working in, whether that's app development, cyber-security, database management - whatever it may be.

      'Programming skills are quite important in these kinds of jobs, with languages like JAVA, R, SQL, and Python being particularly popular. You may also want to research things like Big Data and Machine Learning. Having a strong understanding of mathematics and algorithms is also beneficial.',

    skills:
      'Of course, being able to read and understand code will help you a great deal in this line of work, particularly if looking for bugs. A good understanding of version control is important as you may be involved in handling pull requests and communicating bugs and fixes with a larger team. Tools like Postman are used to test API routes. There are different kinds of QA testers out there and not all of them need code for their job - it varies. For example, QA testers exist in things like localization of video games, and these testers are looking at the output of the translations, making sure it makes sense. Sometimes QA testers in tech are also output-focused too and may not need to be as technically savvy as a developer.',

    skills:
      'Certifications in this field include those from AWS (Amazon Web Services), Azure (Microsoft) and GCP (Google Cloud Platform) and are a good place to start to learn more about what cloud engineering involves.

    role: 'Developer advocate',

They also, however, do things like write documentation, write blogs to keep everyone in the loop on updates, help create roadmaps for a project, public speaking, and much more. Often this role is described as bridging the gap between engineers or developers and members of teams like product or marketing to ensure everyone is on the same page. It should be noted that this sector is sometimes called Developer Relations or DevRel for short.",
    skills:
      'As well as technical skills, you will need to be confident speaking with lots of people and to lots of people. It might be good to start creating content to show you know your stuff when it comes to writing and explaining technical concepts. You will probably want to practice using tools like Markdown for writing READMEs, Notion for product overviews, etc. as these are often employed for documentation.',
